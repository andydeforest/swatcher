Swatcher is a tool for generating random color schemes in order to aid designers. It was started as a project to help me learn ReactJS as well as server-side JavaScript more in-depth. The inspiration for this project came from <a href="https://coolors.co">Coolors.co</a>, which is a much better and more feature-rich version of this application.
